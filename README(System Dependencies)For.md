My repository for my CNU Capstone Project.

Hi, if you're reading this you're interested in my Capstone Project. For this project all you'll need is Android Studio,
an android device with developer debugging enabled, and internet access to be reading this page. Download the zip of this file,
open Android Studio, open the android file and run the build.gradle file. Once built, just run the program with your android device
attacted via usb, and you should be good to go.
